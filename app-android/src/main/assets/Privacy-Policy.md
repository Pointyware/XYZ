Pointyware ("we" or "us") respects your privacy. We created this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, share, and protect your information when you use our Android app, XYZ ("the App"). As this app is intended for labor organization members, it is not intended for children under 16.

Note that we may retain certain information for a limited period as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.

## 6. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. However, no security measure is perfect, so we cannot guarantee the security of your information.
