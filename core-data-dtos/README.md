# Module Core Data DTOs
This module contains the Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) used in the core data layer of the application. DTOs are simple objects that carry data between processes, reducing the number of method calls and improving performance. They are often used to encapsulate data and send it over the network or between different layers of an application.
In this case, we are sharing DTOs between the server and client sides of the application, which allows for a consistent data structure and reduces the need for data transformation.
